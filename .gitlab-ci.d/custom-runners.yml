# The CI jobs defined here require GitLab runners installed and
# registered on machines that match their operating system names,
# versions and architectures.  This is in contrast to the other CI
# jobs that are intended to run on GitLab's "shared" runners.

# Different than the default approach on "shared" runners, based on
# containers, the custom runners have no such *requirement*, as those
# jobs should be capable of running on operating systems with no
# compatible container implementation, or no support from
# gitlab-runner.  To avoid problems that gitlab-runner can cause while
# reusing the GIT repository, let's enable the recursive submodule
# strategy.
